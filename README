# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Encryption Test

This is a basic console application written in C# to demonstrate the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. It's designed for educational purposes as part of a college assignment.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

The program allows users to:
- Input a plain text message
- Choose a numeric key for encryption
- View the encrypted message
- Optionally decrypt the message using the same key
- Repeat the process or exit the application

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The Caesar Cipher shifts each character in the input text by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a key of `3`, `A` becomes `D`, `B` becomes `E`, and so on.

The encryption and decryption logic is handled by the `CaesarCipher` class (assumed to be defined in the `CaesarCipherTest` namespace).

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the program in a C# environment (e.g., Visual Studio, .NET CLI).
2. Follow the prompts in the console:
   - Enter a message to encrypt
   - Enter a numeric key
   - View the encrypted result
   - Choose whether to decrypt or continue

## 🧪 Example

```
Enter a text to encrypt: hello
Enter a key (number): 3

Encrypted Text: khoor

Would you like to decrypt the message? yes

Decrypted Text: hello
Would you like to encrypt another message? no

Goodbye!
```

## 📁 Notes

- No external libraries or installation required.
- This project is intended for demonstration only and is not secure for real-world encryption needs.
- The loop logic ensures the user can continue encrypting/decrypting until they choose to exit.
